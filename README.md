## Story
When the village lived in peace, a group of evil spirits began to undermine the peace with terror and trouble. Many residents are victims of the abduction of evil spirits. The village elders also discussed finding a solution to this problem. In the end, a young man was appointed to eradicate the spirits. Moreover, the young man also lost his brother by a spirit, thus strengthening his intention to take revenge and reclaim his lost brother and restore the peace of the village.
